# Scrivito Example App JS

This is a showcase app, how [Scrivito](https://scrivito.com) is working as a JavaScript application.

## Prerequisites

You need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If you are on MacOS a simple `brew install nodejs@7.10` should do the trick (given, that you have [`brew`](https://brew.sh) installed).

You also need [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. On MacOS a simple `brew install yarn` should do the trick.

Now simply call `yarn` in the commandline to install all js dependencies (which are places in the folder `node_modules/`).

## How to build/compile

Calling `yarn build` will compile all js, html and css and place it in the `build/` folder.

## How to develop

Calling `yarn serve` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). It should also automatically reload the page, once changes to the code (in `src/` have been made).

## How to develop design

Calling `yarn serve:design` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/). It will serve all files from the folder `design/` and the file `src/assets/stylesheets/index.scss` as [http://localhost:4000/index.css](http://localhost:4000/index.css).
